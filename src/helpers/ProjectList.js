    description:" Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and survival rates.My project's goal is to use Deep Learning to provide a more precise method of diagnosing breast cancer. In order to detect breast cancer, our approach uses Deep Learning techniques like convolutional neural networks. The outcome demonstrates that this methodology is far more effective than others, with accuracy levels  92%. Moreover, a web app is also deployed for user-friendly, in order to detect any subsequent sample patient image for predicting benign or malignant.The project aims to assess whether a breast lump could be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using digitized histopathology images of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy  Dataset ",

To do this, I went to a computer selling company and collected their requirements. then we have  distributed all of the work equally and chose to build the application using HTML, CSS, and PHP. While working on it, we shared ideas with one another, and in the end, the project was successful.",

    image: Proj4,
    description:"I would like to discuss a project I worked on called 'Presentation Control by Hand Gestures.' The main objective of this project was to create a system that allows users to interact with a computer or application using hand gestures instead of traditional input devices like keyboards or mouse. In this project, we will use our hand gestures to give input to our program by using python libraries. When we make different hand gestures to the web camera, it will read the data from the image and analyse it to determine what kind of gesture our hand is making. Then it will process that data to perform a particular activity or give some output. The first step towards this process is capturing the hand gesture, then analysing it to get the data of the gesture and action mapped to gestures has to be performed. The webcam detection process is the first step because it detects your hands and serves as a medium for the computer and the human to interact by not using any words or an external input device.",
